I am starting writing in order to improve my English skills. If you are good _in_ | _at_ English, please, PLEASE do not read this, cause it can damage your brain. Actually, I do not recommend reading this and consequent posts at all.

I learn English about half an year with a private tutor. I was learning it before but not as hard as I do it now. I think I improved English skill: I can hardly express my feelings or thoughts. This is not as easy as you might think.  I do not afraid of making mistakes. Who does care? Even native speakers on TV make mistakes. I do not fill guilty.

I do not know about what kind of topics I must write. I think it is good idea to write about learning English language, programming, job, well... about all my life. So, this will be an ordinary blog.

Recently I have written my CV on about page of this site. Well it must be the most concise CV I have ever seen. I read several articles about how make a better CV. The main idea is that HR managers read CVs very quickly. They just look at education info and at an information about previous jobs. I decided not write long stories about how many technologies I know. In my point of view it is a bit stupid to write about them. I just wrote down main points: languages, frameworks and special things about me. I have to go. I will continue this topic next time.
