In previous post I wrote about CVs. I will continue this topic a bit later. 

Today I made a review of my previous post and notice interesting thing: I do not know what a preposition I should use in a sentence "If you are good ( _at_ or _in_) English". Unfortunately, both choices sounds good for me and eventually I google it. A man on forum asks for same question, so I will provide an answer for you:

> If you capitalize the first 'English', then either is acceptable.
> 
> We can say that you are good at or good in various school subjects, but we tend to say 'good at' the various sports, or the arts.
> 
> There is no hard and fast rule for when you should say 'good at' or 'good in', unfortunately.  

I think he right, cause quantity of results on google are almost equal "good at English" - 3,960,000 and "good in English" - 4,650,000.

That is all I will try to write posts as often as I can.
